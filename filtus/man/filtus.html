<h1 style="color: black;">FILTUS</h1>
<big>Filtus is a stand-alone tool for downstream
analysis in high-throughput sequencing projects. It is especially well
suited for Mendelian disease mapping, offering statistical evaluation
of variant sharing across related or unrelated individuals. The program is written in Python, by:<br><br>Magnus Dehli Vigeland, PhD<br>Department of Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital, Norway<br></big><big>Email: magnusdv&lt;at&gt;medisin&lt;dot&gt;uio&lt;dot&gt;no</big><br><big>
<br>Filtus accepts (at least in principle) any format of variant files, as
long as you state which columns contain the essential
information (e.g. chromosome, position, gene and genotype). Standard
VCF files are automatically recognized. Unlike other variant tools, Filtus is completely self-contained and
does not require an internet connection. This may be an important point
if you are not allowed to be online when working with human
sequence data.<br>
</big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><big>The latest version of Filtus is 0.99-94. Take a
look at the <a href="FILTUS/Filtus_changelog.txt" target="_top">changelog</a>
to see recent developments.</big><big> Questions,
bug reports, feature requests and other comments are welcome by email
to magnusdv&lt;at&gt;medisin&lt;dot&gt;uio&lt;dot&gt;no.</big><br>

<h2>Download and installation</h2>
<strong>WINDOWS</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest version <a href="FILTUS/Filtus_0.99-94.zip">here</a>
and unpack the zip-file in any location you prefer. To start the
program, simply double-click on the file Filtus.exe in the
unpacked folder.</li>
</ul>
A couple of things to notice:<br>
<ol>
<li>The windows version of Filtus requires a 64-bit processor.</li>
<li>The unpacked Filtus folder contains a great number of
files in addition to the .exe file. These are for internal use only and
should be ignored (but not deleted) by end users.</li>
<li>To create a Filtus icon on the desktop (Windows 7):</li>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the .exe file</li>
<li>Choose <em>Send to</em> and then <em>Desktop
(create shortcut)</em></li>
</ol>
<li>To uninstall Filtus you can just delete the Filtus folder.
Filtus leaves no footprint on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>MAC/LINUX</h3>
There are no executables for these systems, but if you have
Python 2.7 installed you are welcome to download the source files
and run Filtus from a command line. <br>
<ul>
<li>Download the source files <a href="FILTUS/Filtus_0.99-94_SOURCE.zip">here</a> and unpack
the zip-file in a location of your choice.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and move to the unpacked Filtus folder.</li>
<li>To start the program, execute the command<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> python Filtus.py</span><br>
</li>
</ul>
Note:<br>
<ol>
<li>You need Python version 2.7.x where x is at least 3. (Get
it from <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">python.org</a>
if you don't have it.) In particular, Python 3 will not work.  </li>
<li>For the plotting functionality (QC plots) to work, the two
Python packages <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/">numpy</a>
and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html">matplotlib</a>
must be installed on your system. Make sure you download the version
compatible with your operating system and Python 2.7. On Mac OSX
version 10.6 or later these installations should be quick and easy.
Linux can be a little trickier, but there's plenty of information on
the package's websites.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Loading a test file</h2>
To check that everything is OK, you can load the test file included in the "example_files" folder:<br>
<ul>
<li>Start Filtus.</li>
<li>On the <em>File</em> menu,
choose <em>Load files (simple).</em></li>
<li>Move to the <em>example_files</em>
folder, choose <em>test_file.csv</em> and
press <em>Open.</em></li>
<li>In the Input file settings dialog, click <em>Use
for all files.</em></li>
<li>You should now see the file name in the <em>Loaded
files</em> window, and a row in the <em>Unfiltered
summaries</em> window saying "425 variants in 205 genes". If you
double-click on this row, you should see the contents of the file in
the main window.</li>
</ul>
